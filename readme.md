# Free-Auto-GPT
## Auto-GPT for everyone
I'm newbie programmer, but I wanted to use Auto-GPT in every GPT.
My Goal is to write a library that is:
1. Open-Source Auto-GPT, but it's easy to read the code.
2. Auto-GPT that is bound to nothing. It should be compatible with any GPT. Therefore it should not use functions API, or anything else that can be bound with anything.
3. Easy to install project, no hassle with version compatibility.
